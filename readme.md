## SIMD Vector Processing
In this section, SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) vector processing is utilized to perform operations on multiple data points simultaneously. This approach leverages CPU vector instructions for parallel processing.

### Key Highlights
- C++ implementation with Python integration using `ctypes`.
- Vectorized operations for performance gains on CPU.

## Multithreading with OpenMP
Utilizing OpenMP, this section demonstrates multithreading, where tasks are divided across multiple CPU threads for concurrent execution.

### Key Highlights
- Parallel loop execution using `#pragma omp parallel for`.
- Effective for workloads that benefit from task-level parallelism.

## CUDA for GPU Acceleration
This section covers CUDA, a parallel computing platform and API model that utilizes NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate computation.

### Key Highlights
- Direct implementation of CUDA kernels.
- Leveraging GPU for handling large scale data computations.

## Installation and Usage
